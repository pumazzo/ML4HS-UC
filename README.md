### ML4HS-UC
# Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Health Sciences
## HandsOn repository for the "Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Health Sciences" lessons

### Purpose and objectives
The course aims to provide all the basic theoretical concepts and familiarise participants with some widely used software tools in the field of Deep Learning (primarily the Scikit-Learn and Pytorch framework), with particular attention to biomedical applications.
At the end of the course, the student should be able to independently delve more autonomously into Deep Learning-related topics and, in a specific application area, be capable of finding relevant code examples on the web, understanding them, and then adapting them to the problem of interest.

### Specific objectives
Upon completion of the course, participants will be able to:
1. Explain what Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are and their main areas of application.
2. Illustrate the most important applications of ML/DL.
3. Follow a set of best practices in the development of ML systems and avoid common methodological errors.
4. Use Scikit-Learn for the development and implementation of basic ML analysis.
5. Use Pytorch for the development and implementation of basic Deep Learning systems.
6. Be able to read the documentation of the most common packages and be more autonomous in learning new skills.
